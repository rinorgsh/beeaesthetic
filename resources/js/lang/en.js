    // BIAB Description
    biab_desc_title: 'BIAB',
    biab_desc_text: 'Builder in a Bottle gel, also known as BIAB, is a pigmented builder gel. BIAB contains various nutrients that help nourish and strengthen the nail. The incredible combination of flexibility and strength will allow you to achieve a fine and glossy finish. BIAB gel is perfect for short to medium nails. It can slightly extend the natural nail if one is shorter, but this is limited to a repair. It\'s ideal for brittle and fragile nails or for a finer and more refined result. BIAB strengthens the natural nail and promotes a beautiful "C" curve. It\'s also an ideal treatment for nail biters as it stimulates growth and enlarges the nail plate. Available in a limited range of colors, BIAB can be used alone or combined with semi-permanent polish for a refined look.',

    // Japanese Manicure/Pedicure
    japanese_desc_title: 'Japanese Manicure/Pedicure',
    japanese_desc_text: 'Japanese Manicure/Pedicure is a natural nail treatment designed to strengthen and enhance the natural nail plate by infusing it with a nourishing paste and a mineral powder. The treatment includes cuticle care, nail shaping, followed by the application of a paste made from ingredients such as beeswax, minerals, and vitamins. This technique deeply nourishes and fortifies the nails while providing a natural, healthy shine that lasts for several weeks.',

    // Pedicure
    pedicure_desc_title: 'Pedicure',
    pedicure_desc_intro: 'At Bee Aesthetic, our pedicures are designed to care for your feet with precision, comfort, and expertise.',

    // Brow Lift
    browlift_desc_title: 'Brow Lift',
    browlift_desc_text: 'A Brow Lift, also known as brow lamination, is a treatment that restructures and sets the eyebrow hairs in place to create a fuller, more defined look. The technique smooths and lifts the natural hairs, giving them direction and shape, while maintaining a soft and natural finish. This treatment is perfect for anyone with unruly, thin, or asymmetrical brows, as it enhances volume and symmetry without the need for makeup. The results create the illusion of thicker, groomed brows that frame and open up the face beautifully. With proper aftercare, a Brow Lift can last 4 to 6 weeks, keeping your brows looking effortlessly styled.',

    // Lash Lift
    lashlift_desc_title: 'Lash Lift',
    lashlift_desc_text: 'A Lash Lift is a professional treatment that enhances your natural lashes by lifting and curling them from the root. Unlike eyelash extensions, this technique works with your own lashes, giving them a longer, darker, and more defined appearance while maintaining a lightweight and natural feel. Perfect for those who want to avoid daily use of mascara or eyelash curlers, a Lash Lift opens up the eyes and provides a fresh, wide-awake look. Results typically last 6 to 10 weeks, making it a low-maintenance option for beautifully enhanced lashes.',

    // Laser Hair Removal
    laser_desc_title: 'Laser Hair Removal',
    laser_desc_text: 'Laser hair removal is today one of the most advanced and effective solutions for long-term hair reduction, while respecting the skin. To ensure safe, visible, and lasting results, we work with a state-of-the-art technology: the DIODE ICE LASER QUATTRO-PRO – Royal Edition, recognized as one of the most powerful and advanced laser systems on the market. Thanks to its four complementary wavelengths (755 nm, 808 nm, 940 nm, and 1064 nm), this laser is suitable for all skin types and hair types, across all body areas and all year round. This advanced technology allows for maximum precision and enhanced effectiveness from the very first sessions. Equipped with an "in-motion" handpiece with interchangeable lenses adapted to each treatment area, as well as a digital skin analyzer, every session is fully personalized according to your skin and hair characteristics. The integrated cooling system ensures a comfortable and virtually painless treatment, even on sensitive areas. With its exceptional power and innovative technology, laser hair removal achieves a significant and long-lasting reduction in hair growth within approximately 2 to 5 sessions, while preserving skin integrity. Certified CE, Medical CE, FDA, and TÜV, this laser meets the highest international safety standards. Each session is performed with precision, care, and professionalism, ensuring a safe experience and optimal, long-term results.',

    // Waxing
    waxing_desc_title: 'Waxing',
    waxing_desc_text: 'Waxing is an effective and proven hair removal method for achieving smooth, clean, and long-lasting results. Unlike shaving, waxing removes the hair from the root, resulting in slower, finer, and more even regrowth. This technique provides an immediately smooth finish, leaving the skin soft for several weeks. With regular treatments, hair becomes finer and less dense, making each session quicker and more comfortable over time. Suitable for all body areas, waxing adapts to different skin types and allows for a precise and well-groomed result. It also gently exfoliates the skin by removing dead skin cells, leaving the skin smoother and more even. Performed with high-quality products and professional technique, waxing is an ideal solution for those seeking natural, long-lasting smoothness, while maintaining skin comfort and integrity.',

    // Facial Treatments
    facial_desc_title: 'Facial Treatments',

Lorena specializes in purifying and hydrating facial treatments designed to deeply cleanse the skin while restoring optimal hydration levels. Through carefully selected protocols adapted to each skin type, these treatments help remove impurities, excess sebum, and blackheads, leaving the skin smooth, clear, and visibly healthier from the very first session.

    // FAQ Laser
    laser_section_title: 'FAQ LASER',
    laser_q1: 'What is laser hair removal?',
    laser_a1: 'Laser hair removal is a long-lasting hair removal method that destroys the hair follicle using laser light targeting the pigment in the hair.',
    laser_q2: 'What is the difference between laser and IPL?',
    laser_a2: 'Laser provides long-lasting results by destroying the hair follicle. IPL delivers temporary results, as the hair eventually grows back.',
    laser_q3: 'Is diode laser effective?',
    laser_a3: 'Yes. Diode laser is one of the most effective and widely used technologies for permanent hair reduction, suitable for many skin types.',
    laser_q4: 'How many sessions are needed?',
    laser_a4: 'The number of sessions varies from person to person. It depends on factors such as hair type, treated area, skin type, hair density and the hair growth cycle. A personalized treatment plan is established during the first session.',
    laser_q5: 'Is laser hair removal truly permanent?',
    laser_a5: 'A reduction of approximately 80–90% of hair growth can be achieved. Some fine hairs may remain depending on the area and hormonal factors.',
    laser_q6: 'Is laser hair removal painful?',
    laser_a6: 'The sensation varies depending on the treated area and individual sensitivity, but it is generally well tolerated. Cooling systems make the treatment much more comfortable.',
    laser_q7: 'What length should the hair be before a session?',

    laser_a8: 'Shaving prevents the laser energy from dispersing on visible hair and allows it to target the hair follicle beneath the skin more effectively.',

    laser_a9: 'Yes, provided sun exposure is avoided before and after the session and all professional aftercare guidelines are followed.',
    laser_q10: 'Can blonde, red or grey hair be treated?',

    laser_a11: 'Hair usually sheds within 1 to 3 weeks after the treatment.',

    laser_a12: 'Yes. All bikini areas can be treated (classic, extended, full/Brazilian).',
    laser_q13: 'Can I have a laser session during my period?',
    laser_a13: 'Yes, it is possible. However, the area may be more sensitive during this time.',
    laser_q14: 'Are there any precautions after a session?',
    laser_a14: 'Yes: • Avoid sun exposure, heat, sauna, swimming pools and exfoliation for a few days • Avoid using deodorant for 24 hours after underarm treatments',
    laser_q15: 'When is the best time to start laser hair removal?',
    laser_a15: 'Autumn and winter are ideal, as the skin is less exposed to the sun and sessions can be spaced properly before summer.',
